//8. Write a C program to find whether a given year is a leap year or not.
//What is leap year formula?
//Check if the number is evenly divisible by 400 to confirm a leap year.
//If a year is divisible by 100, but not 400, then it is not a leap year.
//If a year is divisible by both 100 and 400, then it is a leap year.
//For example, 1900 is evenly divisible by 100,
//but not 400 since it gives you a result of 4.75.
